I love ZEN-presentations, especially when they deal with open-source software. To create such files, we need pictures. Many pictures. That’s why I keep stumbling over the question of whether the FOSS licenses also allow us to use icons and logos in the same way as the code? Moreover: Under which conditions may we illustrate our articles with ‘internet-pictures‘ ? I’ve always wanted to make that clear to myself

### A little background

Using photos from the Internet may be technically easy, to use them legally is difficult. Photographs and logos are also subject to the Copyright Act. That means at least that you must not use pictures, photographs, icons, or logos as long as the photographer did not grant you the usage rights. Unfortunately, sometimes the content of the pictures also restricts our exploitation rights. Conversely, freedom of art can occasionally grant us additional rights. Estimating the scope of action in this ‘snake pit’ can be quite complex.
